# Node.js + TypeScript Template

## Why?

While going through freeCodeCamp's APIs and Microservices Projects and I found myself 
repeatedly setting up each project in a very similar way. I thought that this template 
might save some time in the future.

## What's included?

* `typescript`
* `express`
* `dotenv`
* `cors`
* `nodemon`

## Installation

### Install dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Start the server
```bash
$ npm run dev
```
